# Flash_Policy
This is a simple Flash Policy server.  It was written because after trying a few servers available in the public, I could not get 100% reliability with them.   I have achieved 100% reliability with this server on our service.

## Build and Install
 * build the source code, cd src; make
 * run the installer, either redhat/centos or ubuntu 16.04
 
 ## Edit Policy
 vi /etc/flash/policy.txt    -- change for your situation.
 vi /etc/flash/pconfig.txt   -- if you need to change the defaults
